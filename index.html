			<p class="intro">NYC is currently in the midst of a massive volunteer-led undertaking  –  a once every 10 year <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/trees-count"> count of all the trees </a>in the city!
			</p>
			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
				The count is happening as New York City works to meet <a href="https://www.urbanforestplan.nyc/"> Law 148</a>, which codified increasing tree canopy cover in the city to 30% in the next decade. 

			</p>
				<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
				In the face of climate change, trees are critical to reduce pollutants, cool air and ground temperatures, and help soak up stormwater. Those environmental wins also represent real cost savings for the city. Trees save NYC an estimated $260 million in benefits and services every year.

carbon dioxide each year – around the same as 11,000 miles of car emissions. Children in NYC neighborhoods with more trees experience lower rates of asthma.
