			<p class="intro">From pizza crusts to coffee grinds, New Yorkers are developing the habit of separating compostable materials from trash. Now, one year since the program launched across all boroughs, residents continue to <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dsny/news/25-038/for-third-week-row-new-yorkers-broke-yet-another-composting-record-diverting-6-062-000#/0">"smash composting records."</a>

				In <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dsny/news/25-038/for-third-week-row-new-yorkers-broke-yet-another-composting-record-diverting-6-062-000#/0">one week alone</a>, New Yorkers diverted more than 6 million pounds of food and yard waste. 
			</p>
			<p> City data show that in 2024 the amount of compost collected in the five boroughs was <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Monthly-Tonnage-Data/ebb7-mvp5/about_data">up more than 50%</a> compared with 2013 - the first year the city started collecting compost from residences and institutions. </p> </p>
			<p>And not that it's a competition, but according to the Department of Sanitation's press office, Staten Island residents have produced the most compostable material per capita since the program started. </p>

			</div class="container"></div><div class="container"><p>Despite the city's compost participation rates, an analysis by a sustainability professor at Baruch College shows that in 2024, residents still trashed 95% of compostable materials. 
			</p>
			<p>“The disparity between compostable organics collected for composting or anaerobic digestion, and quantities thrown out with trash, stems entirely from low participation rates among residents, property owners, and building managers,” MacBride <a href="https://www.academia.edu/124136399/New_York_City_Residential_Curbside_Organics_Program_FY2024_Quarterly_Capture_Rate_Report#outer_page_22"> in her report</a>. 	
			</p>
			<p>One factor may be that the city only started <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/city-to-begin-issuing-fines-to-new-yorkers-who-dont-compost"> issuing fines </a> for non-participation in spring 2025. The carrot and stick approach may indeed yield more compost compliance in the years to come.
